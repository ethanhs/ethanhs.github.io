<p>tl;dr
Go to <a href="http://apt.cli.rs">http://apt.cli.rs</a> and follow the instructions to add the apt repo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess its only fair to start my new blogging kick by catching up on a project I'd worked on several months ago which is pretty much &quot;done.&quot; I really like several Rust tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine"><code>hyperfine</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a>. I wanted an easy way to install them on Debian-based systems that may not have them in the official repos, so I needed to create my own apt repo. I was originally considering making a ppa, or private package archive, since I mainly use Ubuntu, but I decided I wanted these tools available on Debian as well, so my only option was an apt repo.</p>
<p>It turns out that apt repos are really simple, you just need to serve a directory with e.g. nginx. It took me a while to find a tool I liked using for making the apt repo, however. I started with trying <code>reprepro</code>, but I found it was more annoying to use than I wanted, so I ended up using <a href="https://www.aptly.info/"><code>aptly</code></a>, a newer apt repo management tool.</p>
<p>When setting up the repo, my criteria for inclusion were:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tool must be able to build <code>*.deb</code> packages. This is the package format for Debian/Ubuntu so definitely required</li>
<li>the tool must build those packages. I wanted to use the official/same binaries as those in the Github release</li>
<li>the binary packages must be statically musl-linked. Since various versions of Debian/Ubuntu use different versions of glibc, you can get version compatibility errors if you don't statically link. Statically linking to musl is <em>much</em> easier than glibc, so this seemed to be the best route to avoid compatibility errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these criteria in hand, I then set up the apt repo with the CLI tools that fit and wrote a script to try updating all of the packages, pulling from the official Github releases. I have subscribed to releases on Github from all the repos that are currently included in the apt repo so all I have to do is run the script when a new release comes out from one of the repos. I may end up setting up a cronjob that runs this update script, but I'm weighing whether it is worth any potential risks...</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are interested in using this apt repo, head on over to <a href="http://apt.cli.rs">https://apt.cli.rs</a>, I've written up the commands you need to get started using the apt repo.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions for Rust CLI tools that should be included, please <a href="https://github.com/ethanhs/apt.cli.rs/issues/new">open an issue on the github</a>! If a package doesn't build musl-linked Debian packages, consider opening an issue on that project to add it. However, please <em>do not</em> spam maintainers asking for these packages to be built. I unfortunately do not have time to contribute to the packaging of every great Rust CLI tool, but I can add them to the apt repo if they are packaged already!</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully someone else finds it useful!</p>

            <p>Well, I've decided I want to blog a bit more, in part thanks to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/">Simon Willison's post</a> suggesting keeping a blog is a good idea.</p>
<p>I've changed the UI a bit and I am now publishing via a Github action (I now just need to write a markdown file and push to a git repo!). I hope making it easier to blog will hopefully mean I blog a bit more.</p>
<p>One slight issue I ran into is I would push a commit, then my website would go down. The custom domain setting in Github pages would be reset to empty. At first, I thought this was a bug, how could this get reset so frequently! Turns out Github ties the custom domain to a file named <code>CNAME</code> in the root of the <code>gh-pages</code> branch (or whatever you configure to publish in the settings). I've now set that as a static asset to be included in the root so I won't run into this problem, but rather annoying behavior, my git repo shouldn't be used to store configuration!</p>
